          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>With over 1 year of learning Web Development it has changed my entire life. i have learned alot through
            this Journey.
            last year i got interested in web Development because my Brother has been a Web Developer for the past 3
            years. the first programming language i learned Was Python.
            i made small games which are all clicking games. i have been learning Python for 3 to 5 months and i was
            trying to learn to make a web Application using the python library
            Django.
          </p>

          <p>I did not want to make a web applicarion from Django so i saw what my Brother was doing and Immediatly Got
            Interested In It. I started Learnig the basics of HTML and CSS3 and
            it was the Soo easy to make a Website Using HTML and CSS3. Some people will say coding is very complicated
            but its not. It's like a puzzle that u need to solve. Well i Think of coding like that.
            Dont give up. Try to watch as many Web development Tutorials as possible. Try To atleast do some Progress.
            All the beginner will be really interested at first but then
            they give up. Dont do that. Try.</p>
